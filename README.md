# Module 5 Challenge 

## 1. Combine and Clean the Data
This section is where 2 separate datasets are combined into 1. This allows them to be analyzed as one cohesive 
dataset. To clean the data we checked for null values and changed a data type to datetime to allow for better analysis.

## 2. Determine which Region Sold the Most Products
This is an analysis by the total products sold by location. The location is broken down by region, state and city.

## 3. Determine which Region had the most Sales
This section is a similar breakdown, but instead of looking at the count of units sold we are comparing sales by dollar
amount sold. 

## 4. Determine which Retailer had the most Sales
Section 4 analysis adds the retailer to analyze region and retailer total sales to identify the top selling retailers. 

## 5. Determine which Retailer Sold the Most Women's Athletic Footwear 
Section 5 is a closer look at one product line, Women's athletic Footwear. After isolating one product line we take a 
closer look by retailer, location and the number of units sold. 

## 6. Determine the Day with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
In section 6 the total sales are divided by date. 

## 7. Determine the Week with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
The final section takes the days and then separates them into weeks. This allows the sales to be analyzed and identify
the top performing weeks.
